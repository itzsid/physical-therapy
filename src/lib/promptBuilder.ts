EXERCISE CATALOG (prefer these exact names — they have video demonstrations):
${EXERCISE_CATALOG}

Rules:
- Create 3-4 weeks of progressive exercises
- Each week should have 3-4 exercises
- CRITICAL: Every exercise name must be unique across the entire program — do NOT repeat any exercise in different weeks
- Week 1 should be beginner/gentle, progressing to more challenging
- Use real physical therapy exercises (stretches, strengthening, mobility)
- Strongly prefer exercises from the catalog above, using the exact names listed
- Each exercise needs 3-5 clear instruction steps
- Include either sets+reps OR duration for each exercise, not both
- Output ONLY the JSON object, nothing else`;
