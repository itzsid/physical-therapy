**AI-powered physical therapy, accessible to everyone.**

Physical therapy is expensive ($50-150/session), waitlists are long, and most people with everyday pain — stiff necks from desk work, sore knees from running, tight hips from sitting — never seek help. They either ignore it or scroll through random YouTube videos hoping something works.

**PhysioFlow** lets you describe your pain in plain language, and generates a personalized, multi-week exercise program in seconds. It explains *why* your issue developed (muscle imbalances, postural habits, overuse) and *how* the exercises will fix it — so you understand your body, not just follow instructions blindly.

### What makes it different

- **No sign-up, no cost, no backend** — runs entirely in your browser with progress saved locally
- **Educational, not just prescriptive** — explains the root cause and the therapeutic reasoning behind each exercise
- **Progressive programs** — 3-4 weeks that build from gentle mobility to strengthening, like a real PT would design
- **Video demonstrations** — every exercise links to verified physical therapist videos (Bob & Brad PT)
- **AI-driven personalization** — powered by Gemini, tailored to exactly what you describe

### Who it's for

Anyone dealing with everyday musculoskeletal pain who wants a structured plan — not a replacement for a doctor, but a smart first step before (or between) professional visits.
